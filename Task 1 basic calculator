// The provided Java program is a basic calculator that takes two numbers as input from the user and allows the user to choose an arithmetic operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division) to perform on those numbers. 
It uses a `Scanner` object to read the input values and the user's choice of operation. 
Based on the user's choice, the program executes the corresponding arithmetic operation using a `switch` statement, and then prints the result. 
It also includes error handling for division by zero and invalid operation choices, ensuring that the user receives appropriate messages in such cases.//
