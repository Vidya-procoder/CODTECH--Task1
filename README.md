Overview of Basic Calculator intern
Objective :
The objective of this mini project is to create a simple calculator that can perform basic arithmetic operations. The user will be prompted to enter two numbers and select an operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division). The calculator will then perform the selected operation and display the result.

Key Components
1.User Input Handling
2.Arithmetic Operations
3.Result Display
4.Error Handling

User Input Handling :
The calculator must be able to:
1. Prompt the user to input two numbers.
2. Allow the user to choose an arithmetic operation.
   
Implementation Considerations:
* Use a scanner to read input from the console.
* Ensure that the inputs are valid numbers.
* Validate the operation choice to ensure it is one of the four basic operations.
  
Arithmetic Operations
The calculator will support four basic operations:
1.Addition
2.Subtraction
3.Multiplication
4.Division
Each operation will be implemented as a separate method within the Calculator class. The methods will take two numbers as input parameters and return the result of the operation.

Result Display :
After performing the selected operation, the calculator should display the result to the user in a clear and concise manner.

Implementation Considerations:
* Format the output to ensure readability.
* Display an appropriate message in case of errors (e.g., division by zero).
  
Error Handling :
The calculator must handle errors gracefully. Potential errors include:
1.Invalid Number Input: Ensure the user enters valid numbers.
2.Invalid Operation Input: Ensure the user selects a valid operation.
3.Division by Zero: Handle the case where the user tries to divide by zero.

Implementation Considerations:
* Use conditionals to check for errors and provide user-friendly error messages.
